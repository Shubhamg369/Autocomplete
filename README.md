# Autocomplete

 Autocomplete program works by suggesting words or phrases to the user as they type based on the characters they have entered so far. 
 The program predicts the next characters the user is likely to enter and displays a list of options to choose from.

 This Application predicts what a user intends to type and suggests a list of complete queries that match the user's input. 
 The list is presented in descending order of weight, with the top matching queries appearing first.

## Model

 Created a program that plays the role of a mind-reader, predicting what the user wants to type before they even finish typing it. The program will use a
 list of n terms, each with a weight, to suggest the most probable queries that match the user's input. It's like having a virtual assistant that knows 
 exactly what you're thinking!

Autocomplete has become a ubiquitous feature in today's digital landscape. It's like having a psychic personal shopper that helps you find what you're
looking for before you even realize it. From movie databases to search engines, even our cell phones are getting in on the game, 
making our lives easier one keystroke at a time.

Imagine a world where your digital devices can read your mind and predict your every move! Well, almost. In reality, these applications use historical data 
to calculate the probability of what you're going to type next and present you with a list of the most likely queries. It's like having a crystal ball that 
knows exactly what you want to search for, before you even finish typing.

Autocomplete is the secret sauce that makes many systems work smoothly. For instance, imagine a search engine that can predict what you're going to search 
for before you even finish typing. It's like having a genie that grants your every wish, but without the three-wish limit. However, there's a catch - the 
system has to do this lightning-fast to be useful to you, with only 50ms to spare.

we'll use a clever sorting algorithm to make autocomplete work like magic. We'll sort the terms by query string and use binary searching to find matching 
queries that start with the same prefix. Finally, we'll sort the results by weight, so we get the most relevant suggestions first.

## Interactive GUI

Simply provide the name of a file and an integer k, and voila! You'll have a slick graphical user interface that lets you enter queries and see the top k 
matches in real time.

But that's not all - this program takes it to the next level by opening up a Google search in your browser when you select a term. It's like having your 
own personal research assistant, ready to dive into the depths of the internet to find exactly what you're looking for.

So get your detective hat on and let this program be your trusty sidekick on your next case. The world of information is waiting for you!
